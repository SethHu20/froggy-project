# `project-list.json`

This is a JSON file that stores information of a project you intend to make it publicly accessible. You may access and modify the file in `pages\docs\project-list.json.md`.

Make sure that the project object conforms to the `ProjectProperty` type, which can be found in `components\project\types\Project.tsx`, where you can also find more documentation.
